# ðŸŽ¬ Perfect Pitch - Movie Recommender System Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built with **Python** and **Machine Learning**.
It recommends movies similar to a selected movie based on **tags, genres, and keywords**.
The system uses **Count Vectorizer** and **Cosine Similarity** to find movies with similar content.

**NEW!** ðŸ§  **AI Sentiment Analysis** - Analyze movie review sentiment with 88.9% accuracy!

---

## Features

* Recommend top 5 movies similar to the selected movie.
* Uses **cosine similarity** for accurate recommendations.
* Preprocessed movie tags for better matching using **stemming**.
* Interactive **Streamlit app** for easy usage.
* **AI Sentiment Analysis** for movie reviews (Positive/Negative classification).
* **Confidence scoring** for sentiment predictions.
* **Sample review testing** with pre-built examples.
* Lightweight and easy to deploy.

## How it works

### Movie Recommendations
1. Movie dataset is preprocessed:
   * Tags are lowercased and stemmed using **PorterStemmer**.
2. Text is converted into vectors using **CountVectorizer**.
3. **Cosine Similarity** is calculated between movies.
4. Recommendations are generated based on the most similar movies.

### Sentiment Analysis
1. **TF-IDF Vectorization** converts review text to numerical features.
2. **Logistic Regression** model classifies sentiment (Positive/Negative).
3. **Confidence scoring** provides prediction reliability.
4. **Text preprocessing** ensures consistent analysis.
